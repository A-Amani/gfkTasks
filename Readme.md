### This is my solutions to the GFK interview tasks.

For future work, I would like to:
- write unit tests for tasks two, three and four, 
- add compleat docstrings,
- add CI/CD pipelines,
- For task 3, current solution can already yield very good results (99% accuracy), but for future reference, one can also consider more advanced techniques, e.g. word2vec (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Word2vec)(https://code.google.com/archive/p/word2vec/) should the performance falls overtime, due to more complex feature inputs
